This is a cookbook produced jointly at W3C by:

* The Script Library Community Group (http://www.w3.org/community/scriptlib/)
* The Device APIs Working Group (http://www.w3.org/2009/dap/)
* The WebApps Working Group (http://www.w3.org/2008/webapps/)

Its goal is to document common practices in the production of Web APIs for usage in JavaScript.
We are shying away from calling these "Best Practices" for two reasons:

* Sometimes there are several options and picking one is a matter of tradeoffs rather than 
  obvious superiority.
* It is possible that some options may not be the best in an ideal "start from scratch" world,
  but are nevertheless the ones recommended here for consistency with the rest of the platform.

We are also refraining from calling these "patterns". Our goals are more concrete than that.

Broad feedback from everyone is very much desired. If you are interested, please join the
Script Library Group (it is not just open but also friendly to all). Details can be found at
http://www.w3.org/community/scriptlib/.
